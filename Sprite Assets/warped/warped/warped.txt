Ending

The enemy cruiser appears in front of you. Firing volleys of missiles, balls of
raw plasma, and spheres of energy from its arsenal, it looks deadly.
Nevertheless, you fire back - with twin laser cannons of azure death blazing,
you easily blast a big hole in the enemy's hull. The pilot realizes that he is
no match for you and tries to escape. But no. You don't let him escape. You
fire one last shot at him, and instantly, it explodes in a shower of flames. Oh
yes!


Victory!
